# DXF-go

A DXF implementation for Golang.

It was born from my personal need of a DXF parser for Go and the fact that none exists at the moment.

It was heavily influenced by the great work done at [dxfgrabber](https://github.com/mozman/dxfgrabber).

It currently parses a great part of a DXF file - 2014 compatible. 

It currently doesn't import the Object Section and doesn't generate the files. But it wil :)

There is a lot to be done and help is appreciated.
